## Description
Devon, Ryland, and Cameron's Personal Project for a robot w/ personality over the 2021 October break.

## How To Use
- Power on (Once powered on, the boot up process takes a while)
  - Plug the power from MDRC Bot into the wall
  - Plug the HDMI cable into a monitor
  - Plug a Keyboard & Mouse into the USB port using a splitter
- Open the file directory using the icon at the top of the screen
- Navigate to the main.py file and double click. A window should pop up with a green start button on the top bar
- Press the start button and wait for about 5 seconds for the setup routine to complete. The servos might move a little
to get into position, this is normal
- The white LEDs should now be powered on, and you should be able to wave (with a distance of 8-12 inches) and get a 
wave back
- You can now unplug the USB splitter and monitor and as long as it does not lose power, it should stay functional
- Enjoy! :)

## Known Issues
- The left eye's white LED has power issues
- The button on top of the bot has some design issues leading to it's non-implementation
