## How To Use

  - Plug the power from MDRC Bot into the wall
  - Plug the HDMI cable into a monitor
  - Plug a Keyboard & Mouse into the USB port using a splitter
- Open the file directory using the icon at the top of the screen
- Navigate to the main.py file and double click. A window should pop up with a green start button on the top bar
- Press the start button and wait for about 5 seconds for the setup routine to complete. The servos might move a little
to get into position, this is normal. 
- The white LED's should now be powered on, and you should be able to wave and get a wave back.
- Enjoy! :)
